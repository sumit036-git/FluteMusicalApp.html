## 🔊 How the Sound Works

Each note is synthesized in real time using the **Web Audio API**:

- **Fundamental oscillator** — a pure sine wave at the note's frequency
- **2nd harmonic** — octave above at 18% gain for warmth
- **3rd harmonic** — subtle upper partial at 6% gain
- **Vibrato LFO** — 5.2 Hz modulation that gradually kicks in after 250ms
- **Breath noise** — bandpass-filtered white noise centered around the note frequency to mimic air flow
- **Short delay** — adds a slight reverb-like tail for space
